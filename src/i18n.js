The degree course is divided into a three-year curriculum centred on methodological and general objectives in the sciences of education, also oriented on the teaching of human sciences in secondary education.The specific competencies provided by this course are ensured by the use of various evaluation methods that are adequate for the knowledge and skills to be certified, including the transversal competences that are an integral part of the outgoing profile. Internships are also envisaged, in the form of stays abroad for contact with the territory and work contexts in which educational/training professional skills are required, in order to practice under the guidance of tutors who check the ability of graduates in practice. The three-year course is aimed at acquiring educational knowledge and skills in Educational Sciences that enable the analysis of educational issues and management of the sector, together with teachings focused on historical grounds of the basic disciplines, as well as on the crucial and remarkable issues of diverse investigation sectors that constitute them. Particular attention is given to the appraisal of educational phenomena, by prioritising on the reflection on the diversity and distinction of the processes, the protagonists and the training demand, also in a design and operational sense. Furthermore, the student, following this curriculum, has the opportunity to acquire the necessary credits to access the specialisation for upper secondary education in Human Sciences.",
